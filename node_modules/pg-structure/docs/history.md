# History & Release Notes

###### 3.5.14 / 2017-03-06
* Fixed: If same constraint name is used more than once in same schema (non-unique constraint name), pg-structure was failing.

###### 3.5.11 / 2017-02-21
* Fixed: Column.default() was returning typecast if default value is ''. 

###### 3.5.0 / 2016-05-04
* Added: Relation naming support for CamelCase tables.
* Fixed: Default strategy for Many to Many (`m2m`) and Many to One (`m2o`) relations are selected as 'simple' even 'simple' strategy causes conflict. Now complex is selected when there are conflicts between cross types of `o2m` and `m2m`.
* Added: Relation naming documentation.
* Added: Naming strategy test.

###### 3.4.0
* Changed: `table#descriptionData` tag is changed from `[JSON]` to `[pg-structure]`
* (EXPERIMENTAL) Added: `o2mRelation#generateName()`, `m2oRelation#generateName()`, `m2mRelation#generateName()`. Those methods are highly experimental and may be changed or deleted.

###### 3.3.2 / 2016-02-25
* Fixed: Tables without primary key was throwing exception for `table#primaryKeyColumns`.
* Fixed: `table#hasManyTables` and `table#belongsToTables` were returning array instead of Set.

###### 3.3.0 / 2016-02-24
* Added: `table#descriptionData`, `table#commentData`, `column#descriptionData`, `column#commentData`, `constraint#descriptionData`, `constraint#commentData`. It is possible to store and access JSON in objects' description.

###### 3.2.0 / 2016-02-24
* Added:`constraint#description`, `constraint#comment`.
* Updated: Test ERD corrected.

###### 3.1.1 / 2016-01-30
* Added: `column#referencedColumns`.

###### 3.1.0 / 2016-01-26
* Added: `#array` method is added all Map types to help building arrays in non supporting environments such as nunjucks.

###### 3.0.0 / 2016-01-16
Previous versions of pg-structure are designed to be a build time tool. v3 are designed to be a runtime tool. It is refactored to better performance compared to previous versions.
Internal storage is completely rewritten. Loki DB is excellent product, but it is overkill for this project. pg-structure now uses direct object references for speed up things.
DB interaction is reduced from 9 SQL queries to 3. Those 3 queries are same queries from previous version. So work of other 6 queries are done by Javascript now.

* Breaking Change: `Column#foreignKeyConstraint` is changed to `Column#foreignKeyConstraints`, `Column#referencedColumn` is removed,
because same column may be part of multiple different foreign key constraints which results in referencing different columns
in different tables at the same time.
* Breaking Change: All `...ByName` such as `Table#columnsByName` methods are removed, and collections such as `Table#columns` return Map instead of array or object.
Maps return values in order like arrays and they can be queried with `.has` method like objects.
* Breaking Change: `Column#uniqueIndexesNoPK` is renamed as `Column#uniqueIndexesNoPk`.
* Added: Optional Lazy loading, cache of lazy loaded parts, invalidation logic of cache.
* Added: `pgStructure.serialize` and `pgStructure.deserialize` methods.
* Added: `pgStructure.save` and `pgStructure.load` methods. Load is 10 times faster than querying database. 
* Added: `Column#domainSchema`
* Added: `Constraint#matchOption`, `Constraint#referencedColumnsBy`
* Added: `Table#belongsToManyTablesPk`, `Table#m2mRelationsPk`
* Doc updates and changes.

###### 2.0.8 / 2015-12-09

* Added: `Table#description` and `Table#comment` attributes added to the table object.
* Fixed: Table sql was returning null for table descriptions. 

###### 2.0.5 / 2015-12-08

* Changed: Code and API cleanup and simplification since alpha releases.
* Changed: Array and collection object returning attributes now return empty array or empty object if no result found. Previously they returned null. They are usually used in loops, and this change helps getting rid of null checks.
* Removed: All methods which are duplicate of attributes. They cause duplicated code and don't add any useful contribution. Same can be achieved using attributes with foreach and better can be achieved with for..of. 

###### 2.0.0-alpha.9 / 2015-11-29
* Fixed: One to many and many to one relations duplicates.

###### 2.0.0-alpha.8 / 2015-11-29
* Fixed: Join tables with more than one relations produce warning about non-unique constraint.
* Fixed: referencedTable returns undefined.
* Fixed: Example on README throws exception. Typo corrected. Catch part added.
* Added: New tests for fixed bugs.

###### 2.0.0-alpha.5 / 2015-11-19
* Added: Table#relations and Table#getRelations().

###### 2.0.0-alpha.3 / 2015-11-19
* Fixed: Broken links in documentation.

###### 2.0.0-alpha.2 / 2015-11-17
* Added: Index class is added.
* Fixed: Column#unique was assuming that a column can have only one unique constraint. Now it returns array.
* Fixed: Column#unique was ignoring unique indexes Now it considers unique indexes too.
* Fixed: Many typos in constraint class documentation.

###### 2.0.0-alpha.1 / 2015-11-11
* ** BREAKING CHANGES **
* Completely rewritten.
* Methods are converted to read only attributes.
* New methods are named as verb such as getColumn().
* New classes added: Relation, O2MRelation (one to many), M2ORelation (many to one), M2M Relation (many to many).
* Constraint features that are technically not available in DB Engine moved from `Constraint` class to related `Relation` classes.
* Documentation updated completely and added clearer examples.
* Some method names and attributes are more intuitive than previous version.

###### Why v2 has incompatible changes?
Version 2 is designed to be more elegant and more intuitive. Methods are changed to read only attributes and new methods
 are easily distinguished from attributes with verb based names such as `columns` vs `getColumns()`.

Additionally new `Relation` classes are added. Some of the features are moved from `Constraint` to `Relation`,
 because some features are technically not available in DB Engine and those features misrepresent `Constraint`.
 
For example many to many relations are virtual relationships which do not actually exist in database. They are
tables joined via a third join table.
